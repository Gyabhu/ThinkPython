    Properties and behaviours..


    what is class?
    - Class can be defined as the blueprint for the object.
    - It is User defined prototype for and object
    - We should use "class" Keyword to create a class
    - By convention use Capital letter for class naming, don't use underscore
     for eg.
            class NameStudent:
                a = 1
                b = 2
                def c (self, d):
                    print(d)
                    self.a
    - Use guidelines from PEP 8, for convention of python programming.
    - CamelCase notation is used for class naming.
    -  Object creation in python:
            obj = NameStudent()
            type(obj)
    - Object deletion in python:
            del.obj()
    - Constructor in python:
            __init__(self,a):
            pass
        You can define your own constructor to override the default constructor.


    Methods:
